In computer science, a **lookup table (LUT)** is an array that replaces runtime computation with a simpler array indexing operation, in a **direct addressing** process.
The tables may be precalculated and stored in static program storage, calculated (or "pre-fetched" as part of a program's initialization phase (*memoization*), or even stored in hardware in application-specific platforms.
