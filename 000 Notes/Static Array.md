Fixed length [[Data Structure|container]] containing $n$ elements, indexable from the range $[0,\text { } n-1]$
## Usage
* Storing and accessing sequential data
* Temporarily storing objects
* Used by IO routines as buffers
* [[Lookup Table|Lookup tables]] and inverse lookup tables
* Can be used to return multiple values from a function
* Used in dynamic programming to cache answers to subproblems
## [[Big-O Notation|Complexity]]
* Access – $O(1)$
* Search – $O(n)$
  * Binary search doesn't work in non-sorted arrays!
